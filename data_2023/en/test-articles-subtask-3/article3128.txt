USDA Now Asking People to Register Their Vegetable Gardens for National Database

Why in the world does the United States Department of Agriculture need to know if you have a vegetable garden and furthermore, why would they need that information in a national database? If you understand unlawful executive orders, you’ll know why, but to that in a moment.

Begin by watching the USDA’s taxpayer funded propaganda and pushed on criminal accomplices to the agenda in social media.

The video above is petitioning people to register their local gardens. Don’t do it! It’s none of the fed’s business if you have a garden or not!

By the way, if you were interested in registering a garden, it’s pretty easy to meet their standards.

School gardens, community gardens, urban farms, and small-scale agriculture projects in rural, suburban and urban areas can be recognized as a “People’s Garden” if they register on the USDA website and meet criteria including benefitting the community, working collaboratively, incorporating conservation practices and educating the public.

So, while much of this is true, it should be noted that it has zero to do with the federal government and would be best dealt with by individuals in their own community. In fact, not only is there a push for individuals to garden now, more than ever, but there is talk of building community through things like grand jury, militia and community gardens.

The USDA has this to say about naming the People’s Garden:

The People’s Garden was named in honor of USDA’s founder, President Abraham Lincoln, who described USDA as “The People’s Department.” The first People’s Garden at USDA headquarters was started by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on February 12, 2009 – Lincoln’s 200th birthday.

“…the most valuable of all arts will be the art of deriving a comfortable subsistence from the smallest area of soil.” – Abraham Lincoln

Well, why not pick the most tyrannical president in US history to advance a socialist agenda? Seems appropriate.

The USDA then goes on to invite you into their spider’s web.

People’s Gardens grow fresh, healthy food and support a resilient, local food system; teach people how to garden using sustainable practices; and nurture habitat for pollinators and wildlife, and greenspace for neighbors to gather and enjoy. People’s Gardens all:

- Benefit the community by providing food, beautification, arts, wildlife habitat, education, green space, tree canopy, recreation, volunteer opportunities.

- Are a collaborative effort involving neighbors, co-workers, food pantries, master gardeners, conservation districts, USDA agencies, veterans, youth organizations, seniors, faith-based groups, or others.

- Incorporate sustainable practices such as rain barrels or micro-irrigation, composting, cover crops, pest management, bat houses or insect hotels, and/or native plants.

- Educate the public about sustainable practices and the benefit of local food systems through signage, classes, events, outreach materials, websites, and youth field trips.

“We welcome gardens nationwide to join us in the People’s Garden effort and all it represents,” said Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, “Local gardens across the country share USDA’s goals of building more diversified and resilient local food systems, empowering communities to come together around expanding access to healthy food, addressing climate change and advancing equity.”

Secretary Vilsack added: “We encourage existing gardens and new gardens to join the movement. Growing local food benefits local communities in so many ways, and we offer technical resources to help. Also, it’s a great way to connect with your local USDA team members.”

Matt Agorist comments on this pointing out that the USDA, nor the federal government for that matter, has been authorized to do any of this, let alone keeping Americans healthy. In fact, the USDA does quite the opposite, allowing genetically modified organisms, hormones pumped into animals and terrible upkeep of many animals that will be sold to consumers for food.

Agorist writes:

Again, it is important to point out that the mission statement of the USDA does not involve anything to do with keeping Americans healthy. In fact, their track record over the years has done the complete opposite.

Case in point: In December 2020, a scientific committee, composed of 20 academics and doctors, recommended cutting the limit for added sugars in the diet to 6% of daily calories from 10% in the current guidelines. The group compiled a massive trove of data and presented this request to the USDA citing rising rates of obesity and the link between obesity and health problems like Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

To be clear, you need absolutely 0% of your diet to be comprised of sugar but this panel seemingly knew the USDA — who hands out billions of taxpayer dollars to companies who specialize in addicting Americans to sugar — would never get behind a recommendation against all sugar. So, they offered a slight concession.

This scientific committee asked for a measly 4% drop in the USDA’s recommended sugar intake in foods — providing 835 pages of evidence showing the horrifying effects it is having on children and adults — and the USDA refused.

“The new evidence is not substantial enough to support changes to quantitative recommendations for either added sugars or alcohol,” Brandon Lipps, deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the USDA told the Wall Street Journal at the time.

In December of 2020, it was clear that excessive sugar intake was connected to comorbidities like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity — all of which drastically increased complications from a COVID-19 infection. Yet the USDA — who pretends to care about your health — refused to budge in the slightest.

Now, this same organization is claiming that it wants you to register your vegetable garden so it can place you in a database and put your healthy food source on a map — for your health, of course. You also get a cool sign for your front yard too.

While a handful of folks inside the USDA may have well-meaning intentions behind this program, the behemoth organization’s track record and history clearly indicate that the overwhelming majority of them do not care about your health. Not only do they not care about your health but most of their farm and food budget goes toward subsidizing products that directly harm your health.

So, skepticism over a national garden database run by this organization is entirely warranted. As the world teeters on the verge of nuclear war and economic collapse, remember that in times of war and economic downturns, food is more valuable than gold.
