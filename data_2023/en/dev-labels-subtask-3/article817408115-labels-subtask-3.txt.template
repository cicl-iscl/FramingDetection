817408115	9	The EU's antagonistic stance towards Brexit, which was on show again this week, is not motivated by lofty, internationalist ideals, but by financial factors.
817408115	10	Self-interest comes before respecting democratic decisions.
817408115	11	If we don't get the result we want, vote again.
817408115	12	Or else we just ignore it.
817408115	13	Anyone who still believes the EU supports 'democracy' should reflect on this week's events.
817408115	14	On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May's so-called 'Withdrawal Agreement' was heavily defeated in the House of Commons, with a large number of Brexiteers voting against it.
817408115	15	On the same day, European Council President Donald Tusk, a former Prime Minister of Poland, tweeted: "If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?
817408115	16	".
817408115	17	If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?
817408115	18	— Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) January 15, 2019
817408115	19	The message, was retweeted by, among others, Michel Barnier, the chief EU Brexit negotiator.
817408115	20	We all know, by a process of elimination, what Tusk means by the "only positive solution."
817408115	21	That's Britain staying in the EU and sticking two fingers up at the 17.4m people, many of them from the most deprived parts of the country, who voted to Leave.
817408115	22	EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker meanwhile urged the UK to "clarify its intentions as soon as possible", warning that "time is almost up."
817408115	23	I take note with regret of the outcome of the vote in the @HouseofCommons this evening.
817408115	24	I urge the #UK to clarify its intentions as soon as possible.
817408115	25	Time is almost up #Brexithttps://t.co/SMmps5kexn — Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU) January 15, 2019
817408115	26	It's hard to escape the conclusion that the EU offered Britain such a bad deal because they knew it wouldn't be passed.
817408115	27	Then, maximum pressure could be exerted on theUK to reconsider its decision to leave, or at least kick Brexit into the long grasss, which is what having a second referendum would do.
817408115	28	Right on cue, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of the CDU, and the front-runner to become Germany's next chancellor after Angela Merkel, has made an '11th hour' plea for Britain to stay in the EU.
817408115	29	The emotional plea, which lauds "the legendary British black humour" among other things, comes, appropriately enough, in a letter to the neocon propaganda organ the Times, which supported 'Remain.'
817408115	30	The European establishment is desperate for Britain to reconsider Brexit.
817408115	31	Internationalist ideals about 'preserving European unity', don't come in to it, this is all about protecting income streams.

817408115	33	Consider a few facts.
817408115	34	If Britain does leave without a deal, then the EU as an institution would be considerably worse offThe UK has consistently been one of the top three countries that puts most into the EU budget (after Germany and France).).
817408115	35	It is one of ten countries that puts more into the EU than it gets out.
817408115	36	In 2017, the UK's net contribution was £9bn.
817408115	37	If Britain leaves, the EU faces a financial shortfall.
817408115	38	In 2016, 16 countries were net receivers, including Donald Tusk's Poland.
817408115	39	Little wonder that he regards Britain staying as "the only positive solution".
817408115	40	The very generous financial remuneration packages of EU officials might also be threatened by British withdrawal.
817408115	41	n December, it was reported that the EU's top civil servants would be paid over €20,000 a month for the first time, and that Tusk and Juncker would see their packages rise to €32,700 a month.
817408115	42	Austerity?
817408115	43	Not in Brussels, mon ami!
817408115	44	The EU is a fabulous gravy train once you are on board.
817408115	45	But the gravy train relies on its richest members not leaving, otherwise who's going to foot the bill?
817408115	46	If Britain leaves with 'No Deal', it's not just the EU budget which will take a hit.
817408115	47	In 2017, EU countries sold around £67 billion more in goods and services to the UK, than the UK sold to them.
817408115	48	Europe needs full and unfettered access to British markets, much more than Britain needs full and unfettered access to European markets.
817408115	49	Read more
817408115	50	That's not being 'nationalistic', but simply stating the economic reality.
817408115	51	The country that would lose out the most with Brexit is Germany.
817408115	52	Britain's trade deficit with Germany is higher than with any other country, even higher than China, whose products are everywhere in our shops!
817408115	53	In 2016, the year of the EU referendum, Britain imported around £26 billion more from Germany than it exportedIt's no great surprise therefore to see the president of the Federation of German Industries as one of the signatories of the letter to the Times, pleading for Britain to stay!y!
817408115	54	Repeat after me: "We would miss Britain as part of the European Union.
817408115	55	We would miss Britain as part of the European Union"We also have to discuss fishing.
817408115	56	The other EU countries do extremely well out of the Common Fisheries Policy, which provides them with access to UK waters.
817408115	57	Belgian fleets get around half their catch from British waters!
817408115	58	As reported in the Independent, the Common Fisheries Quota has for the past 34 years given 84% of the cod in the English Channel to France and just 9% to the UK.
817408115	59	Overall, EU vessels take out around four times as much fish out of UK waters as British vessels take out of EU waters.s.
817408115	60	Again, you don't have to be Albert Einstein to work out why the EU doesn't want Britain to leave.
817408115	61	If the EU's commitment to democracy was genuine, they would have done everything they could to make sure the referendum result of June 2016 was implemented.
817408115	62	But the financial hit of Britain leaving is too high.
817408115	63	So, instead they have done everything possible to subvert the democratic will of the people, while at the same time boasting about their commitment to 'democracy.'
817408115	64	Good news for democracy: Parliament is proposing EUR 1.8 billion funding for a new Rights and Values MFF Programme.
817408115	65	Civil society will be our strongest ally to protect the #RuleOfLaw & fundamental rights across the EU!

817408115	67	Of course, the EU is not the only party to blame.
817408115	68	The British government, led by a Remainer, and with Remainers holding prominent positions in the Cabinet, has been pusillanimous.
817408115	69	Theresa May has shown she is desperate for a 'deal' whereas in fact, the ones who really need an agreement to provide continued unfettered access to lucrative UK markets, are the EU.
817408115	70	If the UK government had called Brussels' bluff and announced that Britain would just leave, you can be sure Tusk, Barnier, Juncker and co would have come running with a much better offer.
817408115	71	Their (very high) salaries, and the profits of European businesses, depend on it.
