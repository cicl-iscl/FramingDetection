814777937	1	The Far Right Is Trying to Co-opt the Yellow Vests
814777937	3	This weekend in Manchester, England, Yellow Vest protesters decorated their vests with logos of the far-right English Defense League.
814777937	4	In Edmonton, Canada, the Yellow Vest protesters were joined by members of the anti-Muslim group Wolves of Odin.
814777937	5	The Yellow Vest movement, which began as a nebulous economic protest in France, has found a new life with far-right groups abroad.
814777937	6	In Canada, the movement has spawned regular protests with a strong anti-immigrant message.
814777937	7	In the U.K., pro-Brexit factions have worn yellow vests to harass their rivals.
814777937	8	Participants in the Canadian and British demonstrations have also mixed the French movement with an unhinged American conspiracy theory.
814777937	9	The result is an international movement riddled with extremists, all feeding off the more popular French protests.
814777937	10	The original French Yellow Vest (“Gilets Jaunes”) demonstrations were not without their own far-right element.
814777937	11	Some of the movement’s earliest marches saw reports of racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia, the New Republic reported.
814777937	12	A notorious anti-Semite was photographed as the face of the protests before journalists later recognized him.
814777937	13	A December poll found the movement had the highest favorability ratings with supporters of the far-right politician Marine Le Pen.
814777937	14	But the movement had a broader appeal.
814777937	15	The protests kicked off in November, sparked by a bundle of populist issues, including a new fuel tax and rising income inequality.
814777937	16	Liberal, leftist, and anarchist elements joined the protests.
814777937	17	A popular meme about the protests illustrated the movement’s allure to the political right and left, and to authoritarians and anarchists, alike.
814777937	18	This omnidirectional anger at French President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist policies earned the Yellow Vest movement favorable polling in France—and admiration abroad.
814777937	19	Footage of the protests became popular on far-right and conspiracy Facebook pages in the U.S., where Americans highlighted some protesters’ anti-immigrant sentiments and promoted a hoax about Parisians chanting “we want Trump.” (President Donald Trump later repeated the false claim on Twitter.)
814777937	20	Pro-Yellow Vest memes are popular on Reddit’s biggest Trump page, r/the_donald.
814777937	21	In the U.K. and Canada, in particular, those far-right elements have taken their Yellow Vest admiration offline and onto the streets.
814777937	22	In London and Manchester this weekend, far-right Yellow Vesters rallied in favor of Brexit.
814777937	23	Some of the 40 attendees at the Manchester rally wore vests decorated with slogans by the English Defense League, a far-right Islamophobic group.
814777937	24	“If they want a war we’ll give them a war, let’s give them a fucking war,” one far-right Yellow Vest organizer shouted during a livestream of the London demonstration.
814777937	25	Last month, that same organizer was among a group of Yellow Vest demonstrators who accosted an anti-Brexit politician, calling her a “traitor.” Neo-Nazis previously used term to describe Jo Cox, an anti-Brexit politician who was murdered ahead of the 2016 Brexit vote.
814777937	26	“ U.K. and Canadian Yellow Vest protests are also merging with another dysfunctional, foreign movement: the U.S.-based QAnon conspiracy theory.
814777937	27	”
814777937	28	Meanwhile, the far-right group Wolves of Odin have been a persistent presence at Canadian Yellow Vest demonstrations every weekend, the Star Edmonton reported.
814777937	29	Some Canadian Yellow Vesters have denounced the Wolves of Odin, and leftist groups have used the Yellow Vest movement to push their own agendas in Canada and the U.K.
814777937	30	But the protests’ far-right elements remain highly visible.
814777937	31	Evan Balgord, director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network told the Star that the largest Facebook page for Canada’s Yellow Vest movement (which boasts more than 100,000 members) is rife with racism.
814777937	32	“If you go through it at any given moment, you’re going to find anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, you’re going to find death threats, you’re going to find other calls to violence, racism directed to Muslims—and it doesn’t take very long,” Balgord told the Star.
814777937	33	“I found my first death threat in five minutes.”
814777937	34	A brief scroll of the page on Monday afternoon surfaced anti-Muslim and anti-gay posts, as well as conspiracy theories about the New World Order.
814777937	35	U.K. and Canadian Yellow Vest protests are also merging with another dysfunctional, foreign movement: the U.S.-based QAnon conspiracy theory.
814777937	36	The organizer of this weekend’s London Yellow Vest demonstration wore a vest with a QAnon slogan on it, the BBC’s Mike Wendling reported.
814777937	37	QAnon is an American conspiracy theory that falsely claims Trump’s rivals are involved in bizarre crimes, namely child sex-trafficking and cannibalism.
814777937	38	Despite the theory’s obvious falsehoods, failed predictions, and origins in the U.S., it has attracted international fans who believe QAnon’s claims about global crime rings and imminent mass arrests.
814777937	39	The theory has a growing Canadian fanbase, The Daily Beast previously reported, and Canadian Yellow Vest protesters have carried QAnon signs since at least mid-December.
814777937	40	Although QAnon is led by an anonymous forum user who claims to be a Trump insider, its followers have increasingly expanded on the conspiracy theory, making it difficult for even its original author to control.
814777937	41	“I really feel like we're heading for a Q movement where Q isn't necessary,” Mike Rothschild, a writer documenting QAnon’s evolution remarked on Twitter this weekend.
814777937	42	That leaderless conspiracy movement could end up looking a lot like elements of the U.K. and Canadian Yellow Vest movements: nebulous in structure, but undeniably far-right.
814777937	43	A Friday picture of a Canadian Yellow Vest protester showed the movement’s possible future.
814777937	44	Far from the economic populist platform of France, the demonstrator’s vest was decorated with a jumble of Trumpian and conspiratorial language.
814777937	45	“Q,” the vest read.
814777937	46	“No Trudeau.
814777937	47	CBC = Fake News.”
