830359423	1	Blackmail, Balderdash, and the Brexit
830359423	3	After a lot of drama, British Prime Minister Theresa May came back from Brussels with a breakthrough on Brexit.
830359423	4	Only it wasn’t.
830359423	5	While the changes to the protocol that governs the implementation of the Irish Backstop are an improvement they are far fro enough to allay the rightful fears of Brexiteers and the Northern Irish.
830359423	6	From the beginning of this process, the EU has been in blackmail mode.
830359423	7	They’ve made it clear that they would not negotiate in good faith or even at all.
830359423	8	That much has been clear.
830359423	9	The biggest question has been whether May herself was working in the British people’s best interest or was she simply a stalking horse for further EU integration of the entire continent of Europe.
830359423	10	Never forget that the EU has imperial ambitions.
830359423	11	Those that have been its architects saw it as regaining the mantle of the center of the world as the U.S. bankrupts itself maintaining an empire around the world, fighting against the rise of Russia and China.
830359423	12	It sits in the weeds, making byzantine bureaucratic law and building both a fiscal and political union through these under-handed back doors.

830359423	14	And the people of Europe have woken up to it.
830359423	15	The Brits voted to leave the EU because of this.
830359423	16	Euroskeptic parties are rising across Europe.
830359423	17	The latest rebuke of the EU came in Austria’s Salzburg, a traditional center-left stronghold just voted for a Lega-style nationalist/populist majority.
830359423	18	Now people like Theresa May, who never supported Brexit, are using this negotiating period to hand to the EU everything it wants in the Withdrawal Agreement to blackmail the British people to accept an even worse arrangement than had they not voted to leave in the first place.
830359423	19	This point cannot be understated.
830359423	20	Because it is the model for how the EU will fight the rising opposition to its rule.
830359423	21	The withdrawal agreement was crafted by Germany and not negotiated by Jean-Claude Juncker and Michael Barnier to punish the U.K. for standing up to the inevitability of the EU.
830359423	22	It is a message and a warning to Italy, Hungary and Poland.
830359423	23	It was designed to cause irreparable damage to the U.K. with the long-term effects of destroying the majority political parties and fanning separatist instincts in Wales and Scotland.
830359423	24	And no one is more to blame for this mess than the members of Parliament who continue to virtue signal about the horrors of a no-deal which the British people have become less and less scared of every day.
830359423	25	Poll after poll shows overwhelming rejection of May’s Merkel’s deal as well as growing support for a No-Deal Brexit.
830359423	26	And if the members of parliament who continue to go through the pantomime of an existential crisis would leave it aside and simply say that’s it, no deal it is, that would end the uncertainty and the worry that is now the dominant narrative in the press.
830359423	27	Businesses are relocating, shipments are stopping, etc.
830359423	28	All because of Brexit, they argue.
830359423	29	No, all because of MP’s who refuse to embrace the situation as it stands and face the reality that sovereignty is more important than a quarter or two of tightened belts and some annoying paperwork.
830359423	30	Moreover, the biggest fear now is the one which is that Britain ends up better off if they not only threw off the shackles of the EU but also its own corrupt and, frankly, traitorous leadership.
830359423	31	Theresa May’s performance in parliament before the latest vote was almost convincing.
830359423	32	But, as always, when someone is giving you an ultimatum, my way or the highway, it’s masking an alternative choice.
830359423	33	The Dublin Unionist Party and the European Research Group within the Tories understand this.
830359423	34	I suspect in his heart of hearts Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn
830359423	35	And the reason for this is May was always on their side.
830359423	36	It’s not a negotiation when there’s only one side represented.
830359423	37	This is why Juncker et.al.
830359423	38	refused to negotiate in any meaningful way.
830359423	39	They didn’t have to.

830359423	41	And that is simply blackmail.
830359423	42	What is obvious watching British parliamentarians at this late stage is that a majority of them are unwilling to face reality that the EU is not in their best interest.
830359423	43	Because any organization that would blackmail rather than negotiate is not an organization anyone decent person would want to be a member of.
830359423	44	Fears over a No-Deal Brexit are overblown.
830359423	45	If these same MP’s that are so worried about the uncertainty created by the Brexit process would simply end that uncertainty by backing No-Deal then certainty would return.
830359423	46	It might not be the certainty that is the easiest to swallow for both sides but it will be certainty.
830359423	47	Mr. Juncker made it clear there is nothing better forthcoming.
830359423	48	That’s an insult and it should be treated as such by Parliament.
830359423	49	But it won’t be as MP’s roll over, show Juncker their bellies and hand-wring about how unfair it all is again later this week.
830359423	50	They cannot see the bigger picture that it is the EU that has the weak hand, not them.
830359423	51	They are too blinded by ideology and fear to see that.
