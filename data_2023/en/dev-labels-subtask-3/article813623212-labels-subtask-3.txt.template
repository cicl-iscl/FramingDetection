813623212	1	'Wishful thinking': Tory MPs dismiss May's hopes for change of heart on Brexit deal
813623212	3	Jeremy Hunt insisted Theresa May can still salvage her Brexit deal today - despite Tory MPs branding her hopes of getting it through Parliament 'wishful thinking'.
813623212	4	The Foreign Secretary said he believed the PM will 'find a way' to win the looming Commons vote by getting assurances with 'legal force' that the Irish border backstop is only temporary.
813623212	5	But senior Conservatives said they were detecting no sign of a shift in opinion over the Christmas break, warning that 'nothing has changed'.
813623212	6	Brexit hostilities have been resumed with just a fortnight to go until a titanic Commons showdown on the PM's package.
813623212	7	The moment of truth was delayed last month when Mrs May conceded she was on track for a catastrophic defeat.
813623212	8	The premier used her New Year message to urge her warring MPs to 'to put our differences aside and move forward together'.
813623212	9	She said passing the deal would mean the UK can thrive and 'start a new chapter with optimism and hope'.
813623212	10	Mr Hunt added his voice to the pleas today, saying that the deal Mrs May had thrashed out with the EU can 'give us absolutely everything we wanted'.

813623212	14	Speaking on a visit to Singapore, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that MPs could get 'absolutely everything we want' from Theresa May's Brexit deal.
813623212	15	'We have a clear opportunity to leave the EU on 29th March,' he said.
813623212	16	'It has the vast majority of things that people wanted, not absolutely everything.
813623212	17	'The question is, can we turn this into something that gives us absolutely everything we wanted, and I believe we can.
813623212	18	'There will be some tough negotiations to follow in the years ahead but I think getting this clearer language on the backstop will help to get it through Parliament.'
813623212	19	Mr Hunt said the PM was aiming to get concessions with 'legal force' that the Irish border backstop will only be temporary.
813623212	20	'Theresa May has been very clear this isn't just about words but about text which has legal force,' he said.
813623212	21	'She has also been very straightforward about this - the EU has agreed the backstop is temporary and that's a word they have agreed.
813623212	22	'So what we're saying, very simply, is we're not asking for anything new but we are asking you to define what temporary means, so we can have confidence we're not going to be trapped in the customs union for ever against the wishes of the British people.'
813623212	23	He also said that a second referendum would be 'devastating' for the UK and the public's faith in politicians.
813623212	24	Leading Cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also came out strongly for the package earlier this week.
813623212	25	Mrs May has been engaged in another frantic round of diplomacy as she tries to wring more concessions out of Brussels that could help her get the deal through Parliament.
813623212	26	But the EU has flatly dismissed the idea of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement painstakingly put together over two years of negotiations.
813623212	27	The bloc also insists there cannot be a time limit on the backstop - although both sides say it should be temporary and fall away once a wider trade pact is sealed.
813623212	28	However, senior Cabinet ministers are still privately convinced they will get movement from the EU that could win round enough MPs.
813623212	29	Under the backstop arrangements, the whole UK would stay in a customs union with the EU to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - while Northern Ireland would obey some single market rules.
813623212	30	Brexiteers have condemned the proposals as they could restrict the UK's ability to do trade deals elsewhere.
813623212	31	And the DUP, which is propping up Mrs May in power, has voiced fury that it would leave Northern Ireland operating under different rules to the rest of the UK.
813623212	32	Corbyn at odds with Labour activists over Brexit referendum Pressure is mounting on Jeremy Corbyn to back a second Brexit referendum after polling showed huge support among Labour members - and many ready to quit if he ignores them.
813623212	33	The Labour leader has been desperately resisting calls from within his own ranks to endorse another national vote, keeping the option open while insisting he prefers an election.
813623212	34	But a study of more than 1,000 Labour members found that 72 per cent want Mr Corbyn to throw his weight behind the policy.
813623212	35	There was also backing for a second referendum among wider Labour supporters, including 61 per cent of those who voted for the party at the 2017 election.
813623212	36	The work suggests that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leadership's approach to leaving the EU.
813623212	37	Almost a quarter (23 per cent) of Labour members put Mr Corbyn's failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.
813623212	38	Mr Corbyn again dodged today as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists.
813623212	39	Speaking at a rail fares protest in London, he said: 'The issue of another referendum was of course one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.
813623212	40	'We haven't yet had a vote and I think the Government really should be ashamed of itself.
813623212	41	Jacob Rees-Mogg, who heads the Eurosceptic ERG bloc of Tory MPs, said there was 'no sign at all' that the tide was turning.
813623212	42	'I think it was based on the false premise that when at home in our constituencies people would tell us to back the deal,' he told MailOnline.
813623212	43	'Instead, as far as I can tell, the message is stand firm against a bad deal.'
813623212	44	Sir Bill Cash said: 'My New Year's resolution - not to vote for the PM's Withdrawal Agreement this January.
813623212	45	'Parliament exists to make our laws.
813623212	46	This Agreement lets the 27 EU countries impose laws on the UK as never before in our history- behind closed doors with no transcript and no UK at the meeting.'
813623212	47	Former Cabinet minister Sir John Redwood, who was knighted in the New Year honours sparking claims the government was trying to buy votes, made clear he had not changed his mind.
813623212	48	'I see some are wrongly suggesting I am wobbling over voting against the Withdrawal Agreement,' he posted on Twitter.
813623212	49	'They are mischief making & should read my blogs to understand why I oppose it.
813623212	50	They would then see I have several fundamental objections which cannot be fixed by tweaks or reassurances.'
813623212	51	Another senior Tory MP told MailOnline: 'Nothing has changed, as someone once said.'
813623212	52	They added: 'I think there was optimism over Christmas about people coming back in a better frame of mind, but it is wishful thinking...
813623212	53	'I haven't head from anyone who has changed their minds.'
813623212	54	Mr Hunt denied that he wanted the UK to follow Singapore's social or political model post-Brexit but said he admired its economics.
813623212	55	He said: 'We do not want and do not seek to emulate the social or political model of Singapore.
813623212	56	'I was health secretary for nearly six years, I am a passionate defender of a health service that is free at the point of use and, if you remember, I secured quite a lot of extra money for the health service during my tenure, so those things are very different.
813623212	57	'But in terms of their economic model, there are some things we can learn.'
813623212	58	Mr Hunt praised Singapore's education investment and 'long-term approach' to economic development, particularly in fibre optics.
