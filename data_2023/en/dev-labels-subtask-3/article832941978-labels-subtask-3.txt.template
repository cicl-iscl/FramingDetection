832941978	1	Adam Schiff rejects reports that Mueller indictments are over
832941978	3	House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff has said that he believes there will likely be further indictments from Robert Mueller as the full contents of his report are looked at in closer detail.
832941978	4	Schiff suggested he would call the special counsel before a House panel if necessary to learn what is contained in the long-awaited document.
832941978	5	'If necessary, we will call Bob Mueller or others before our committee, I would imagine the judiciary committee may call the attorney general if necessary,' the California Democrat said during an interview Friday on CNN.

832941978	7	House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said Friday that he's willing to subpoena Robert Mueller and Attorney General Barr, if needed, to push for disclosure
832941978	8	'At the end of the day, the department is under a statutory obligation to provide our committee with any information regarding significant intelligence activities, including counterintelligence.
832941978	9	And it's hard to imagine anything more significant than what Bob Mueller has been investigating.
832941978	10	'We have a right to be informed, and we will demand to be informed about it.'
832941978	11	Special Counsel Robert Mueller turned over his report to AG William Barr Friday afternoon
832941978	12	Schiff was asked by Wolf Blitzer if he would be satisfied if 'the most sensitive information' obtained by Mueller was only shared with the so-called 'gang of eight'.
832941978	13	'No, it would not suffice.
832941978	14	Now, there may be a select sub-section of information they feel they can only share because of the very sensitive sources which derived the information, but the volumes of information that has been found needs to be shared with the whole committee so we can evaluate what steps have to be taken to protect the country.
832941978	15	'We're going to need to have the same sort of discovery that we saw during the last Congress, and indeed it may be far more extensive than that, to make sure that U.S. policy is driven by U.S. interest and not because the president or anyone around him is looking to make money from the Kremlin on a tower or anything else.'
832941978	16	In another interview with MSNBC, Schiff said that it is entirely likely that more indictments could be forthcoming, saying instead it is 'entirely possible, if not likely, that there will be' more.
832941978	17	'Well, what it means is that the office of the special counsel, which is essentially a contract attorney to the Justice Department, that that office won't be bringing any further indictments,' he said.
832941978	18	'It doesn't mean, of course, that main justice or the Seventh District of New York and the Eastern District or others may not bring indictments.
832941978	19	'In fact, given the lengthy redactions in many of the pleadings of the special counsel eluding to other investigations, I think it's entirely possible if not likely that there will be other indictments.
832941978	20	'Now, how central or peripheral they'll be to the core issues of potential conspiracy is yet to be determined.'
832941978	21	How the news broke: This is the letter Bill Barr, the attorney general, sent to the chairs and ranking members of the Judiciary Committees, revealing the Mueller probe is over
832941978	22	Though Trump himself has said the report should be made public, it's not clear whether the administration would fight subpoenas for testimony or block the transmission of grand jury material.
832941978	23	If the administration decides to fight, lawmakers could ask federal courts to step in and enforce a subpoena.
832941978	24	A court fight could, in theory, reach the Supreme Court.
832941978	25	But few tussles between Congress and the White House get that far.
832941978	26	They often are resolved through negotiation.
832941978	27	The Democrats, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, could also formally ask Mueller to send his committee evidence that could be used in possible impeachment proceedings against Trump, as suggested by Benjamin Wittes, a senior Brookings Institution fellow and editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog.
832941978	28	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are demanding to see the full Mueller report immediately
832941978	29	'There is no reason on God's green earth why Attorney General Barr' shouldn't release the full report, said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer
832941978	30	With Attorney General William Barr vowing to rush out information on the report's 'principal conclusions' as soon as this weekend, Democrats were insisting they see both the complete document and the evidence in its entirety.
832941978	31	'It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said in a joint statement.
832941978	32	'Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any 'sneak preview' of Special Counsel Mueller's findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,' the leaders said.
832941978	33	'The American people have a right to the truth.
832941978	34	The watchword is transparency,' they said.
832941978	35	President Donald Trump talks with reporters before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, in Washington
832941978	36	Speaking to reporters Friday, Schumer said: 'The American people have a right to the truth.
832941978	37	The watchword is transparency.'
832941978	38	He added: 'The president himself has called without qualification or the report to be made public.
832941978	39	There is no reason on God's green earth why Attorney General Barr should do any less.'
832941978	40	Schumer predicted the effort ultimately would prevail due to public sentiment.
832941978	41	'The demand of the public is overwhelming to see the report when it's on such a serious matter and it will be made public.
832941978	42	Public pressure will force it to be,' he said.
832941978	43	Barr himself pledged transparency during his Senate confirmation hearing.
832941978	44	But the strong defender of presidential power also left open the possibility he would share his own summary, rather than the report itself, to Congress – a move that would provoke a fight with the Democratic House.
832941978	45	Although there were reports Mueller would bring no additional indictments, there remained the possibility of indictments already sealed, or that another body such as the Southern District of New York wold bring indictments.
832941978	46	Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, told MSNBC there was a 'high probability' that could happen.
832941978	47	'I think there is a strong possibility of additional indictments, including president Trump's family,' Blumenthal said Friday evening.
832941978	48	'Maybe not by the Department of Justice, main Justice.
832941978	49	But by other offices.
832941978	50	I know that you want to stick to the Mueller report.
832941978	51	But the Mueller report cannot be viewed in isolation,' the former prosecutor and Trump nemesis continued.
832941978	52	'Any more than an investigation, even though it may end, cannot lead to additional investigative leads and actions.
832941978	53	And so I think there's a high probability of additional indictments.'
832941978	54	With the White House already resisting document requests from the Democratic Congress, lawmakers want to get hold of Mueller's work product and use it as the basis for additional investigation.
832941978	55	Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary panels, bluntly told CNN Friday afternoon: 'We want the full report.
832941978	56	We want it now.
832941978	57	We want it before the president is able to get it or make any edits.'
832941978	58	Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), who is ramping up his own investigations
832941978	59	The president is a subject.
832941978	60	He's a subject of the investigation.
832941978	61	He has an inherent conflict of interest,' Swalwell continued.
832941978	62	'It's really inappropriate that he would even touch this.
832941978	63	IF he didn't do anything wrong, he would keep his hands off it.'
832941978	64	Sand Senate Intelligence Committee Co-chair Democrat Mark Warner: 'Congress and the American people deserve to judge the facts of the Mueller report for themselves.
832941978	65	It must be provided to Congress immediately, and the AG should swiftly prepare a declassified version for the public.
832941978	66	Nothing short of that will suffice.'
832941978	67	Warner added on Twitter: 'Any attempt by the Trump Administration to cover up the results of this investigation into Russia's attack on our democracy would be unacceptable.'
832941978	68	House Judiciary ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, a Republican of Georgia, joined the call for the release of the Mueller report.
832941978	69	'After nearly two years, the special counsel has concluded his investigation, and I look forward to reviewing Attorney General Barr's report carefully, when it becomes available.
832941978	70	I fully expect the Justice Department to release the special counsel's report to this committee and to the public without delay and to the maximum extent permitted by law,' Collins said.
832941978	71	'We want the full report.
832941978	72	We want it now,' said Rep. Eric Swalwell of California
832941978	73	Special Counsel Robert Muller arrives at his office building, Thursday, March 21, 2019, in Washington
832941978	74	Barr told key lawmakers: 'I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,' he wrote.
832941978	75	That raised the possibility that he would provide a mere summary of Mueller's findings, which could leave information that didn't result in charges out of the matter.
832941978	76	Trump said that he would have no objection to the public release of Mueller's findings – although he was not specific as to what he would see released.
832941978	77	'I don't mind,' he said.
832941978	78	'Let it come out,' Trump declared.
832941978	79	'Let people see it.'
832941978	80	And White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told the public via Twitter Friday afternoon: 'The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report.'
