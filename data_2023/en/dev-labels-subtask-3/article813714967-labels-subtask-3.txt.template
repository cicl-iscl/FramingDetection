813714967	9	It is hard to overestimate what a political disaster Brexit has been ever since the referendum passed on June 23, 2016.
813714967	10	Britain, and to some extent the EU, have been almost completely deadlocked for two years.
813714967	11	Now the committed date when Britain will leave the European Union is March 29, 2019.
813714967	12	The problem has always been the border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and (Southern) Ireland (which will remain part of the EU).
813714967	13	Ireland and Northern Ireland have an extremely violent history described as “The Troubles,” which were resolved by the Good Friday agreement in 1998 which, among other things, committed to remove any physical border between the two and allow free movement of goods and people.
813714967	14	It has been apparent since the beginning that no solution exists to meeting the objectives of the “Brexiteers” (the people who wanted Brexit) and maintaining a barrier-free border.
813714967	15	So that problem has always been insoluble and remains so today.
813714967	16	So there are four possibilities for what will happen on March 29:
813714967	17	“Crashing out of the EU” – a no-deal Brexit.
813714967	18	Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan.
813714967	19	Killing the whole Brexit thing.
813714967	20	Kicking the can down the road by extending the March 29 date.
813714967	21	There is no U.K. majority for any of these options, but if there is no agreement, then the default will be a no-deal Brexit.
813714967	22	In my opinion, a way will be found to avoid this because it will be catastrophic for the economies of both the U.K. and E.U.
813714967	23	I had thought that the Brexit decision was final once Britain submitted its two-year notice on March 29, 2017.
813714967	24	However, in the last few months, an E.U.
813714967	25	court has issued an opinion that Britain can reverse the Brexit decision, provided that it does so with finality and not just to start up a new two-year negotiation.
813714967	26	So that is an option.
813714967	27	However, if Britain’s government invokes it, it will invoke the howls of hell from people who say that the government is violating the will of the people.
813714967	28	Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan, which I summarized in detail in October, is a transition plan that many consider to be the worst of all possible worlds.
813714967	29	The whole point of why the Brexiteers wanted Brexit was to get away from the E.U.
813714967	30	regulations, E.U.
813714967	31	taxes, and the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
813714967	32	In the transition period, all of these will remain, with the additional restriction that the U.K. will have to obey all the regulations and pay all the money, but will have no say in changing them.
813714967	33	This plan is almost Karmic retribution for the idiocy of going ahead with Brexit in the first place.
813714967	34	However, few people like Theresa May’s plan and many pundits say that when it comes to a vote in Parliament on January 14, it is unlikely to pass.
813714967	35	That brings us to the last option: kicking the can down the road.
813714967	36	It is believed that if the U.K. requested it, then the E.U.
813714967	37	would agree to extend the March 29 date.
813714967	38	That would give time for more debate.
813714967	39	Some people want to use that time to hold a new Brexit referendum.
813714967	40	The problem with that option is that even among the few people who want a new referendum, there is no agreement on what the question would be.
813714967	41	Would it be the same two choices as the 2016 referendum?
813714967	42	Or would it be the three choices, something like the first three options in the list above?
813714967	43	So really, no one knows what is going to happen out of this mess, but my bet would be that they will find some way to “fudge,” or to kick the can down the road.

813714967	45	Big upsurge in migrants crossing English Channel by boat, especially Iranians
813714967	46	A big increase in the number of migrants illegally crossing the English Channel from Calais, France, to Dover, England, is being blamed on the chaos surrounding Brexit.
813714967	47	There are reports that human traffickers are telling migrants that crossing from France to Britain will be much more difficult after March 29 because of Brexit and charging the migrants €15,000 or more to cross the Channel in a cheap dinghy.
813714967	48	At the same time, security has been toughened around ports and the Channel tunnel and authorities have been cracking down on migrants in northern France.
813714967	49	However, there are still many more migrants who cross to Britain by stowing away on trucks that travel through the tunnel.
813714967	50	This is actually a fairly small number of migrants, but it has become a major political issue in Britain.
813714967	51	It is far smaller than the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Greece, where the E.U.
813714967	52	border force has been patrolling the waters.
813714967	53	But political pressure has forced Britain’s Home Secretary to reassign to British patrol cutters from the Mediterranean to the English Channel.
813714967	54	Many of the migrants are from Iran.
813714967	55	This is believed to be the result of a policy that Serbia implemented between August and October 2017, offering visa-free travel to people from Iran for 30 days.
813714967	56	More than 40,000 Iranians visited Serbia, but it is believed as many as 12,000 did not return home after 30 days, but instead moved through the Schengen Zone to western Europe and, in particular, to Calais, France, hoping to reach Britain.
813714967	57	The trip across the English Channel is 21 miles, but cross-currents can make the trip much longer.
813714967	58	The trip can be particularly dangerous due to high seas and busy shipping lanes.
813714967	59	If a British patrol boat captures the migrants in British waters, then they are required to take them to Britain; otherwise, the patrol boat can return them to France.
813714967	60	When a migrant reaches Britain, he is evaluated for eligibility for asylum.
813714967	61	Iranians are likely to be granted asylum because of Iran’s human rights record.
813714967	62	For that reason, migrants from Iraq or Syria often claim to be from Iran.
