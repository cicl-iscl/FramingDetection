832931332	3	Our increasing acceptance of government corruption and deceit will continue to erode our national integrity and, eventually, our freedom
832931332	4	What happens after no one goes to jail?
832931332	5	And so, the Mueller Investigation into the alleged Trump-Russian Collusion to fix the 2016 general election against Hillary goes the way of similar investigations that have proceeded it.
832931332	6	Nowhere.
832931332	7	In the relatively recent past, we’ve watched, not in any particular order, Plamegate, Benghazi, the IRS suppression of Tea Party groups, Fast & Furious, Uranium One, and that brief puppet show that accompanied the F.B.I.
832931332	8	inquiry into classified documents found on Hillary Clinton’s private server.
832931332	9	Further back, there was the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, the assassination of the President of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem, and his brother/advisor Ngo Dinh Nhu – twenty days before another Presidential assassination on Nov. 22, 1963.
832931332	10	And, oh, can’t forget Iran Contra and Whitewater.
832931332	11	And so, the Mueller Investigation of alleged Trump collusion with the Russians to assure his election joins the growing list.
832931332	12	Now, this evening from the Swamp, comes confirmation that, all along, there’s been no there there.
832931332	13	About half the adults in America knew as much from the get-go.
832931332	14	The intrepid, two-year running, deadly serious reports on the “investigation” coming from the breathless voices of the “news” media, supported by indignantly outraged politicians, ran the dial on our Bravo Sierra Meter into the red zone, almost daily.
832931332	15	Suppose they’ll apologize to the nation?
832931332	16	Many of us have learned from past experience how to see.
832931332	17	For example, we soon realized there was no serious inquiry into Benghazi.
832931332	18	Same for the Clinton Foundation, as well as for all the nefarious deeds related to the nation’s premier power couple.
832931332	19	We shrug—it is what it is—what can we do about it?
832931332	20	The FISA Court, created in the wake of 911, has become the means to conduct secret, unsubstantiated, investigations against political adversaries.
832931332	21	Hi ho.
832931332	22	NSA vacuuming up of a kazillion phone calls is, we’re told, for our protection and well-being.
832931332	23	Sure it is.
832931332	24	Unmasking of persons, led by the Obama administration’s U.S.
832931332	25	Ambassador to the U.N. and the Queen of Unmasking, Samantha Powers, was, well, it must have been justified, right?
832931332	26	Part of keeping us safe.
832931332	27	In the end, the important question is this: What happens when no one goes to jail?
832931332	28	After it becomes clear, even to Helen Keller were she here to witness events, that it’s all been a charade.
832931332	29	And the people indicted by Mueller et al were collateral damage in what the President has long called a “Witch Hunt.” Like a Salem Witch, it was him they meant to burn alive.
832931332	30	And don’t think they won’t keep trying, even though this episode has come to a flat end.
832931332	31	Even on this evening, March 22, 2019, it’s clear that liberals on virtually all the major networks, including FOX, will say, “Well, yea, but it’s not over yet.
832931332	32	There’s still…and…bla bla bla.” Breathe deep, and sip wine to stomach it all.
832931332	33	We wonder, a lot of us: Has government corruption always been a constant in the Swamp?
832931332	34	Of course, it has.
832931332	35	But does it seem to be escalating in its frequency and intensity?
832931332	36	Yes, it does.
832931332	37	And in other cases, both mentioned above and unlisted, what happens when none of those who plan, execute, and benefit from the corruption—what happens when not one of them go to jail?
832931332	38	Or, are in any meaningful way, otherwise held accountable?
832931332	39	We should assume these two things will happen.
832931332	40	First, our increasing acceptance of government corruption and deceit will continue to erode our national integrity and, eventually, our freedom.
832931332	41	Until, eventually, we will lose the right to claim it.
832931332	42	And the second thing to happen will be this: The corruption will continue to replicate itself and get worse.
832931332	43	In the days ahead, we will be repeatedly reminded that Robert Mueller III is a man of stellar integrity, heralded by those in the Swamp as a fearless crime fighter, a former Marine hero in Vietnam.
832931332	44	I have a friend from college who was a genuine gun fighter.
832931332	45	He joined the Corps as a Private—came out a Major, with a Silver Star.
832931332	46	He’s featured in a book about the legendary First Marine Recon in Vietnam.
832931332	47	He’s alive and well today.
832931332	48	In my high school band, I sat next to a small, Hispanic kid.
832931332	49	Once out of school, he joined the Marine Corps, and went to Vietnam.
832931332	50	He died there.
