833032367	22	SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER WILL NOT RECOMMEND ANY MORE INDICTMENTS AS PART OF HIS INVESTIGATION, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED FRIDAY EVENING.
833032367	23	A senior Justice Department official announced the development shortly after the special counsel submitted its final report to U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
833032367	24	Barr will now review the report and write his own report on Mueller’s findings and present them to Congress as soon as this weekend.
833032367	25	“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” the attorney general wrote in a letter to Republican and Democrat leaders on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.
833032367	26	He also said at no time did the Justice Department prevent Mueller from any actions he sought to make during the course of his investigation.
833032367	27	President Trump’s initial reaction to news of the report’s delivery is that he is “glad it’s over,” reported ABC News.
833032367	28	In a separate statement, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow said:“We’re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations.
833032367	29	Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps.”
833032367	30	Following confirmation of the report’s delivery, several top Democrat lawmakers demanded its immediate public release.
833032367	31	Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Mueller’s findings “must be provided to Congress immediately, and the Attorney General should swiftly prepare a declassified version for the public.
833032367	32	Nothing short of that will suffice.”
833032367	33	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) echoed Warner’s remarks, stating: “It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress.”
833032367	34	Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the former chair of the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, said in a statement “that we still haven’t seen any evidence of collusion.”
833032367	35	“Republicans and Democrats have roundly praised Mueller’s reputation for integrity and thoroughness.
833032367	36	Now that he’s wrapped up his investigation, Attorney General Barr must provide Congress and the American people with the findings to finally put an end to the speculation and innuendo that has loomed over this administration since its earliest days,” Grassley said.
833032367	37	“Attempts to keep the collusion narrative alive, especially for political reasons, will only serve to further harm our political discourse and play into the hands of our foreign adversaries.”
