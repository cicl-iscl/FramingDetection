Nearly 8% of people living in San Francisco and Seattle plan to MOVE elsewhere

Residents in San Francisco and Seattle are more likely to move to a different city as they experience high crime rate and homelessness, according to a new survey.

For the first time ever, the American Housing Survey asked residents in the nation’s 15 major cities if they planned on moving, with many Dem-led cities leading the way in the looming exodus.

About 7.6 percent of those in San Francisco said they wanted to move to a different city, with Seattle coming in second at 7.2 percent.

Following them was Washington D.C and Detroit, who both reported that 6.8 percent of residents wished to move away, with Detroit coming in fifth at 6.6 percent.

New York City appeared to have the most content residents out of the bunch, with only 3.2 percent saying they wished to move to another city. Both Phoenix and Philadelphia followed behind with 3.7 percent.

San Francisco’s problems began to inflate in 2019, with the pandemic only making things worse for the Golden Gate City.

According to the latest available FBI Unified Crime Report, San Francisco had the highest overall crime rate of the 20 largest cities in the United States, recording 6,917 crimes per 100,000 population in 2019.

That was more than double the crime rates in New York and Los Angeles, and well above the rates in the next largest US cities: Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix.

A year later following the Black Lives Matter protests, the call to defund the police grew among Democratic leaders.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed demanded cities defund the police last year, announcing that the Golden Gate City would be one of the first to do so and promising to slice $120million from the budgets of its police and sheriff’s departments.
