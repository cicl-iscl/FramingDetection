Energy Crisis Driving Up Cremation Costs in France, Reports Suggest

Soaring energy prices have been driving up costs for cremation in France, with prices expected to rise by more than a third next year, media reported on Thursday.

French news channel BFMTV cited estimates of funeral cost tracking service MPF which show that the price of gas accounts for 15% to 25% of the funeral price.

Cremation costs may reportedly rise 35% next year to the average 911 euros ($887).

Cremation costs ranged between 605 and 675 euros before energy shortages became a problem.

Cremation has until recently been a cheaper alternative to a burial but large funeral firms, which are not eligible for energy subsidies, are expected to pass the bills for the soaring gas prices on to the bereaved.
