817176202	1	The British People, as Well as the Politicians, Don’t Want Brexit
817176202	3	The British Parliament just handed Prime Minister Theresa May one of the biggest legislative defeats in parliamentary history, by rejecting her Brexit plan.
817176202	4	These House of Commons politicians may simply be following the will of the British people, who now reject the idea of leaving the European Union only a few years after narrowly approving the plan in a referendum.
817176202	5	May should either call for a new referendum, or resign, if she cares about British democracy.
817176202	6	Europe Cut Off?
817176202	7	The British people have always had some ambivalence about joining the European Union.
817176202	8	It’s more about being independent than being anti-European.
817176202	9	This was best illustrated by a story my political science professor told me years ago.
817176202	10	After a violent storm in the English Channel, telecommunications between the island and the mainland were severed.
817176202	11	The headlines in Europe read “Terrible Storm: England Cut Off.” The United Kingdom newspapers touted the headlines, “Terrible Storm: Europe Cut Off.”
817176202	12	Polls going back to February of 2012 confirm this.
817176202	13	Opposition to the EU in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was much stronger, with 45 percent wanting to leave the EU and only 35 percent wanting to remain, with 20 percent unsure and the remainder saying they would not vote.
817176202	14	Opponents of the EU largely led the polling landscape from 2012 to 2015.

817176202	16	From 2015 to 2016, there was a seesaw battle between proponents of Brexit and opponents, who wanted to stay in the EU.
817176202	17	It seemed to change from survey to survey.
817176202	18	The supporters of leaving the EU narrowly won out, largely due to wild claims from Brexit supporters, like the UK Independence Party (UKIP), that the country would make a lot of money by leaving the EU.
817176202	19	In addition, support for Brexit was also fueled by opposition to Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, a free market champion and EU supporter who became pretty unpopular quickly due to a series of scandals, and his policies that struggled to help the UK recover from the Great Recession.
817176202	20	I went into a Conservative Party club in 2012 in Oxford and could barely find a Cameron supporter in his own party’s get-together.
817176202	21	I found just a tiny photo of him that had been moved to the back of the building.
817176202	22	Support for the EU Rises
817176202	23	But something happened after the Brexit vote.
817176202	24	Polls show that the number of undecided votes dropped precipitously, and support for the EU rose.
817176202	25	As people realized that voting for Brexit wasn’t like winning the lottery, and that the country was due to face a lot of economic pain for breaking with the European Union, support for Brexit slipped in the polls.
817176202	26	Additional polls consistently show that those favoring the EU would win a new referendum, as people realize the consequences of Brexit, as well as the false promises such a plan won’t deliver.
817176202	27	May, who assumed power after Cameron resigned, sought to capitalize on the Brexit vote by calling for early elections.
817176202	28	Instead, this Brexit cheerleader was humiliated at the polls, and her party lost its majority in power, relying on a Northern Ireland party to cling to power.
817176202	29	May sought to negotiate the Brexit plan with the EU.
817176202	30	But the plan was so unpopular in 2018 that she tabled it, hoping the House of Commons would like it better in 2019.
817176202	31	They liked it less, leading to May’s Waterloo in the vote.
817176202	32	Not since Tory Prime Minister Lord North received the news from Yorktown about the success of the American Revolution has a British politician been so humiliated.
817176202	33	Time for Another Vote
817176202	34	Failing to learn the lessons of her defeat, May refused to call for a new referendum, calling such a move “antidemocratic.” But what’s more antidemocratic: giving the people a new vote and a second chance, or leaving her tiny parliamentary coalition in charge of making the policy.
817176202	35	When it comes to democracy, to paraphrase from the film The Princess Bride, I would say “You keep using that word.
817176202	36	I do not think that words means what you think it means.”
817176202	37	Former Labor PM Tony Blair, and former Conservative PM John Major, have called for a new vote, showing a rare moment of bipartisanship.
817176202	38	Polls estimate that at least 55 percent of the British people want to stay.
817176202	39	It’s time to have a fake news-free referendum that doesn’t involve racism or the stabbing death of a parliamentarian who opposed Brexit.
817176202	40	Let the British determine their own fate before the end of March, and let’s not leave it up to a lame duck prime minister who doesn’t seem to command a quarter of the House of Commons.
