813949697	1	Police training up for deployment to NI in case of no-deal Brexit
813949697	3	Almost 1,000 police officers are being trained up for deployment in Northern Ireland in case of violence stemming from a no-deal Brexit.
813949697	4	Chiefs from the Police Service of Northern Ireland had asked for the reinforcements to handle any problems that may arise from a hard border.
813949697	5	It is thought large numbers of officers from Britain on the streets could anger Irish republicans.
813949697	6	But additional officers are thought to be necessary to cover the possibility of violence with a no-deal Brexit.

813949697	8	The rioting started after the police forced the Protestant Orangemen's traditional 12 July parade against the wishes of a group of Nationalist residents
813949697	9	The training will mean officers are pulled from their regular duties, according to The Guardian.
813949697	10	News of the continued no-deal Brexit preparations came on another difficult day for Theresa May.
813949697	11	What is the Irish border backstop and why do Tory MPs hate it?
813949697	12	The so-called Irish border backstop is one of the most controversial parts of the PM's Brexit deal.
813949697	13	This is what it means: What is the backstop?
813949697	14	The backstop was invented to meet promises to keep open the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland even if there is no comprehensive UK-EU trade deal.
813949697	15	The divorce deal says it will kick in automatically at the end of the Brexit transition if that deal is not in place.If effectively keeps the UK in a customs union with the EU and Northern Ireland in both the customs union and single market..
813949697	16	This means many EU laws will keep being imposed on the UK and there can be no new trade deals.
813949697	17	It also means regulatory checks on some goods crossing the Irish Sea.
813949697	18	Why have Ireland and the EU demanded it?
813949697	19	Because Britain demanded to leave the EU customs union and single market, the EU said it needed guarantees people and goods circulating inside met EU rules.
813949697	20	This is covered by the Brexit transition, which effectively maintains current rules, and can in theory be done in the comprehensive EU-UK trade deal.
813949697	21	But the EU said there had to be a backstop to cover what happens in any gap between transition and final deal.
813949697	22	Why do critics hate it?
813949697	23	Because Britain cannot decide when to leave the backstop.
813949697	24	Getting out - even if there is a trade deal - can only happen if both sides agree people and goods can freely cross the border.
813949697	25	Brexiteers fear the EU will unreasonably demand the backstop continues so EU law continues to apply in Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland MPs also hate the regulatory border in the Irish Sea, insisting it unreasonably carves up the United Kingdom..
813949697	26	What concessions did Britain get in negotiating it?
813949697	27	During the negotiations, Britain persuaded Brussels the backstop should apply to the whole UK and not just Northern Ireland.
813949697	28	Importantly, this prevents a customs border down the Irish Sea - even if some goods still need to be checked.
813949697	29	The Government said this means Britain gets many of the benefits of EU membership after transition without all of the commitments - meaning Brussels will be eager to end the backstop.
813949697	30	It also got promises the EU will act in 'good faith' during the future trade talks and use its 'best endeavours' to finalise a deal - promises it says can be enforced in court.
813949697	31	What did the legal advice say about it?
813949697	32	Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said even with the EU promises, if a trade deal cannot be reached the backstop could last forever.
813949697	33	This would leave Britain stuck in a Brexit limbo, living under EU rules it had no say in writing and no way to unilaterally end it.
813949697	34	The DUP on whom the Tories rely for a Commons majority, insisted their objections to Irish border backstop arrangements remained, while the EU closed ranks in the face of demands for new concessions.
813949697	35	After a meeting with the Prime Minister, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said:'The Withdrawal Agreement, as currently proposed, flies in the face of the Government's commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU.''
813949697	36	Mr Dodds again attacked the proposed Irish border backstop, which would see the UK remain under EU customs rules if no wider trade deal was agreed by the end of a withdrawal transition period, as unnecessary.
813949697	37	However, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would not accept any changes to the deal that would make the backstop inoperable.
813949697	38	Mr Varadkar said he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel by telephone on Thursday and the two leaders agreed to 'stand by' the Brexit deal.
813949697	39	He said: 'We're happy to offer reassurances and guarantees to the UK, but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November.'
813949697	40	Mr Varadkar said the conversation, which lasted about 40 minutes, focused on securing the ratification of the deal.
813949697	41	The remarks are a blow to the Prime Minister, who is trying to get concessions on the Irish backstop plans in the hope it will convince MPs to vote her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament later this month.
813949697	42	Mr Varadkar's comments came as the EU confirmed 'no further meetings are foreseen' with the UK on updating Mrs May's Brexit deal because negotiations have concluded.
813949697	43	A spokeswoman for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the leaders of the remaining 27 countries 'have been very clear' that what is on the table 'will not be renegotiated'.
813949697	44	At a press conference in Brussels, Mina Andreeva, deputy chief spokeswoman for the European Commission, was asked what talks would be held before the Commons has its say on the deal in the week of January 14.
813949697	45	She said: 'We have said many times the deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible.
813949697	46	'And the EU27 leaders confirmed on December 13 in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated.'
813949697	47	Ms Andreeva said the EU side have 'started the ratification process' on the terms in the Withdrawal Agreement, adding: 'For now, no further meetings are foreseen between the Commission's negotiators and the UK negotiators as the negotiations have indeed been concluded.'
813949697	48	She said Mr Juncker is 'always willing to listen to Mrs May's views on the backstop', but when asked what else he can do to help her deal get through Parliament, she rebuffed any chance of altering the backstop as it currently stands.
813949697	49	And Mrs May's deal drew criticism from Tory former minister Ben Gummer, who co-authored the Conservative manifesto at the last election.
813949697	50	Mr Gummer, who lost his Ipswich seat at the 2017 election, said it would leave the country poorer for generations.
813949697	51	He told the BBC: 'I think it is probably unique in modern parliamentary history, because Members of Parliament are being asked to walk through the division lobbies to make the country, and their constituents, permanently poorer and less secure.
813949697	52	'Not just in one generation, but in two or three.'
813949697	53	Mr Gummer said if Parliament failed to find a route through the Brexit situation, a new referendum should be held.
813949697	54	The comments came as Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the consequences of a no-deal Brexit would be 'considerable' in the agricultural sector.

813949697	57	Ireland will demand hundreds of millions of euros in aid from the EU if the UK crashes out of the bloc without a deal, Dublin warns
813949697	58	Irish agriculture minister Michael Creed said it would take 'mega money' to ease the impact of a no-deal Brexit
813949697	59	Ireland will demand hundreds of millions of euros in aid from the EU if the UK crashes out of the bloc, the country's agriculture minister warned today.
813949697	60	Michael Creed said it would take 'mega money' to ease the impact of a no-deal Brexit - with beef, dairy and fishing among the most vulnerable sectors.
813949697	61	The warning came as Brussels again appeared to dismiss Theresa May's plea for fresh concessions to help her get the Brexit package through the Commons later this month.
813949697	62	An EU commission spokeswoman also said there were no plans for any further negotiations with the UK - despite the PM insisting talks are ongoing.
813949697	63	The latest standoff has sent the chances of a no-deal Brexit spiralling, as Mrs May looks down the barrel of near-certain defeat in the Parliamentary showdown due in the week beginning January 14.
813949697	64	Killing off the plan could throw the government into chaos, with the UK set to crash out of the bloc by default at the end of March unless politicians can agree another course.
813949697	65	Irish PM Leo Varadkar is seen as having been one of the main obstacles to sealing a deal, after he insisted on a 'backstop' to guarantee no hard border with Northern Ireland.
813949697	66	The DUP has condemned the proposals because they risk splitting the UK, while Brexiteers say it will prevent the country striking trade deals elsewhere.
813949697	67	However, the intervention by Mr Creed today underlines the threat of disruption Ireland faces if there is no Brexit deal.
813949697	68	Theresa May (pictured in Downing Street today) is looking down the barrel of near-certain defeat in the Parliamentary showdown due in the week beginning January 14
813949697	69	Speaking about the need for support from the EU in the event of no deal, he told the Irish Independent: 'You're looking at hundreds of millions here.
813949697	70	'Between the beef industry and the fishing industry we're talking mega-money.'
813949697	71	Nearly 80 per cent of Irish exporters deliver products to Britain, according to 2016 government figures.
813949697	72	The country is also considered a vital 'land bridge' to the European continent
813949697	73	'There is a high level of awareness of Ireland's unique exposure to the UK food market,' Mr Creed said.
813949697	74	'I think nobody wants to talk about it right now because there is still a hope and expectation that a level of sanity will prevail.'
813949697	75	But, he added: 'In racing parlance the odds are slashed on a hard Brexit.
813949697	76	If Britain crashes out of the European Union on March 29, Creed said he hoped an EU grant would be approved at a Luxembourg summit of EU farming ministers in April.
813949697	77	Dublin outlined its no deal contingency plans before the Christmas break.
813949697	78	They include schemes for port overhauls, a fund for Brexit-specific tax staff and talks to preserve the island's integrated electricity network.
813949697	79	Up to 45 pieces of emergency legislation would be required.
813949697	80	At a press conference in Brussels this morning Mina Andreeva, deputy chief spokeswoman for the European Commission, was asked what talks would be held with the UK before the Commons vote.
813949697	81	She said: 'We have said many times the deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible.
813949697	82	'And the EU27 leaders confirmed on December 13 in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated.'
813949697	83	Ms Andreeva said the EU side have 'started the ratification process' on the terms in the Withdrawal Agreement, and confirmed Brussels is ready to start preparations on a new trade deal 'immediately after the signature' on the deal from the UK Government.
813949697	84	She added: 'For now no further meetings are foreseen between the commission's negotiators and the UK negotiators as the negotiations have indeed been concluded.'
