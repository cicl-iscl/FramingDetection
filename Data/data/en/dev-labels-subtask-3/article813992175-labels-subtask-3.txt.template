813992175	3	Barely two days have passed since the New Year and the remoaners are doing what they do best.
813992175	4	Fear mongering.
813992175	5	Unfortunately the British Parliament appears to be infested with them, as there is speculation that the government will begin a publicity campaign, aiming to warn of potential adverse effects of a no deal departure.
813992175	6	But would this outcome be as bad as so often claimed in the mainstream media?
813992175	7	And would it be preferable to Prime Minister Theresa May’s much maligned Chequers plan?
813992175	8	Sputnik spoke with UKIP founder Alan Sked for more insight on the issue.
813992175	9	Sputnik: Does Theresa May have any chance of passing her Brexit deal?
813992175	10	And why is it so bad?
813992175	11	Alan Sked: It’s very difficult for her to pass it because it is very bad, as we have to pay the EU thirty nine billion pounds and we don’t get very much in return.
813992175	12	It sets up a two year transition period, during which we, in effect; remain members of the EU, but we don’t have any say in decision maker’s decisions that they take, we’d just have to accept whatever rules and regulations they pass without being able to influence or veto them.

813992175	14	Then there’s another thing that says; if we don’t get a free trade agreement by the end of the transition period, we’d enter a thing called the backstop that comes into play to safeguard the Irish border, which means that Britain and Northern Ireland become part of the single market and customs union.
813992175	15	We couldn’t get out of it; it goes on indefinitely and we’ve got no means of unilaterally exiting, we’d have to get the permission of the EU to come out, and if we want that permission, we’d have to get that permission from the twenty seven different countries, and each one of them could ask for trading concessions in order to get their permission, so it’s a dreadful deal.
813992175	16	Sputnik: Are WTO rules now the solution to the ongoing political deadlock?
813992175	17	Alan Sked: WTO’s a perfect solution.
813992175	18	We trade with America, China, India and most of the world under WTO rules already and different parts trade with each other on these rules.
813992175	19	The EU trades with America, China, India and different places on WTO rules; we’re set up to trade with large parts of the world already in that way so it won’t make very much difference.
813992175	20	I’d be very happy with WTO rules.

813992175	22	Alan Sked: They need our economy more because they sell about twice as many goods to us, as we do to them.
813992175	23	We’re its largest trading customer and they need access to the UK market and if they are denied that; then who’s going to buy German cars, French wine, Italian leather goods etc.
813992175	24	?
813992175	25	They are highly dependent on our market, and I don’t think they realise just how much.
