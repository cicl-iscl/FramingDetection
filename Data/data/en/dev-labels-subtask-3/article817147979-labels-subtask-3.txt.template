817147979	7	The parallels between British and American politics are simply eerie.
817147979	8	In 2016, after British voters unexpectedly rebelled against their political class and chose to leave the European Union, Donald J. Trump took to calling himself Mr. Brexit—and guess what?
817147979	9	Since then, of course, the political classes in both countries have been conspiring to reverse the election results.
817147979	10	But Theresa May just suffered the greatest defeat of any British Prime Minister when her BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) deal negotiated with the EU was rejected by the House of Commons 432-202.
817147979	11	Subsequently, May has survived a vote of No Confidence and the outlook is confused.
817147979	12	But clearly the Deep State has not yet tamed British populism.
817147979	13	A good omen for Trump?
817147979	14	May’s defeat was terrible enough, but it was even worse because the “payroll vote,” of Members of Parliament (= Congressmen) holding government office, is around 140.
817147979	15	Hence, BRINO only attracted around 60 backbenchers (who within reason can vote as they like).
817147979	16	The Spectator has a list, with names, of the 118 Tories to voted against May’s deal.
817147979	17	This gives May and her government a tremendous problem because ever since she came back with the draft deal she has been saying it is her way or the highway, stubbornly insisting that no other deal is available.
817147979	18	But such was the deal’s subordination of UK interests that many commentators argued would leave the UK as a vassal state.
817147979	19	[May’s Brexit deal: the legal verdict | The PM’s plan isn’t bad – it’s atrocious, by Martin Howe QC, Spectator, November 24, 2018]
817147979	20	This fiasco is largely due to having a Remainer PM (May opposed Brexit although she wasn’t brave about it) and a Remainer-dominated cabinet.
817147979	21	At best their heart isn’t in Brexit; at worst they are deliberately trying to sabotage it.
817147979	22	Similarly, many Trump Administration officials and GOP Congressional leaders have been all too obviously hostile to his agenda.
817147979	23	With a Leaver PM and a Leaver-dominated Cabinet, there would still have been a potential problem with Remainer-dominated Houses of Commons and Lords.
817147979	24	But it is doubtful that Remainers in Parliament would have been so blatant in their attempts to frustrate a straightforward Brexit.
817147979	25	The defeat of May’s deal is encouraging for Brexiteers inasmuch as the overwhelming result should have greatly lessened any thoughts May had of coming back with a few insignificant cosmetic changes.
817147979	26	However, it’s still a possibility.
817147979	27	And there are many other threats to thwart a true Brexit.
817147979	28	If there is a serious breakdown of party discipline, there is nothing to stop Remainer MPs doing anything they want because the House of Commons still has a substantial majority of Remainers.
817147979	29	But a bright spot for Brexiteers: the date for the UK’s leaving is fixed in an Act of Parliament.
817147979	30	Section 20 of the European Union (Withdrawal ) Act 2018 states ‘“exit day” means 29 March 2019 at 11.00 p.m.’
817147979	31	To change the date of the UK leaving the EU requires either an amendment to or a repeal of the Act.
817147979	32	And unless the Brexit leaving date is changed, it does not matter what else happens, because there is a legal obligation on the UK to leave.
817147979	33	A second referendum cannot be held, an extension of Article 50 cannot be sought by the UK or granted by the EU and Article 50 cannot be revoked.
817147979	34	In addition Remainers, however aided and abetted by the unethical Remainer Speaker of the Commons John Bercow, cannot ultimately stop the UK leaving the EU on 29 March.
817147979	35	There are serious obstacles to the House of Commons voting to amend or repeal the leaving date.
817147979	36	To begin with it would nakedly expose the Remainers’ anti-democratic partisanship.
817147979	37	Ever since the referendum, most Remainers have consistently bleated that they honored the result, although obviously hoping to sabotage Brexit.
817147979	38	Having their true feelings exposed will be more than embarrassing, because there are many constituencies (= Congressional districts), especially ones held by Labour MPs, that voted heavily to leave the EU while their MP voted Remain.
817147979	39	Leave voters might well punish Remainer MPs in Leave constituencies.
817147979	40	Then there is the entirely practical alternative option of a No-Deal Brexit—more precisely, leaving without any negotiated deal with the European Union and proceeding to trade under World Trade Organization rules.
817147979	41	Significant numbers of Leave MPs have embraced the idea, for two reasons: first, it simplifies matters because it is ready-made system and allows business to plan; second is that it makes it harder for remainder politicians to sabotage Brexit after the UK has formally left the EU.
817147979	42	Of course, WTO membership does not mean that future bilateral trade deals cannot be struck.
817147979	43	So what is really happening—in the U.K. and the U.S.?
817147979	44	The Deep State is often portrayed as a conspiracy.
817147979	45	In fact, it is better thought of as a blind sociological event.
817147979	46	There is no group of conscious conspirators, simply people being groomed to have the same opinions or at least saying they do.
817147979	47	What has happened in the UK (and the rest for the West to varying degrees) is the success of the long march through the institutions.
817147979	48	That is what ultimately has given the UK an elite (politicians, mediafolk, teachers etc) who are overwhelmingly Politically Correct internationalists.
817147979	49	And it’s those people who are at the forefront of the attempts to sabotage Brexit.
817147979	50	How did it come about?
817147979	51	A German student leader of the 1960s Rudi Dutschke, echoing the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, put forward the idea whereby societies could be subverted from within by those of an internationalist bent who would patiently work to gain positions of power and influence.
817147979	52	Eventually there would be enough of such people to change the policies of Western societies from national to internationalist ones.
817147979	53	That point was reached in the UK at least 50 years ago and the Politically Correct stranglehold on our society is now complete.
817147979	54	The capture of Western societies by internationalists has allowed them to permit and even overtly encourage mass immigration of people from different cultures, denigrate their own societies, traduce the West and its native populations generally and introduce gradually the pernicious Totalitarian creed of Cultural Marxism which has “anti-racism” (in reality anti-white racism) at its heart.
817147979	55	The last brick in the Politically Correct building is the increasingly draconian treatment of anyone who refuses to toe the line—increasingly including the use of the criminal law and imprisonment.
817147979	56	That is why Western politics until recently has been so ideologically monotone.
817147979	57	Brexit was a revolt against that mentality.
817147979	58	Most MPs overtly or tacitly supported the idea of the referendum and its result by promising it in election manifestos, in Parliament and through their passage by large majorities of the legislation needed to both set up the referendum and make provision for its implementation.
817147979	59	But by doing so, MPs forfeited their right to do anything other than honour the result of the referendum.
817147979	60	That applies just as much to Remainer MPs as Leaver MPs.
817147979	61	Sadly, the behaviour of the most committed Remainers with power and influence (including many MPs and peers in the House of Lords) has shattered utterly the idea that the UK is a fully functioning democracy.
817147979	62	Rather, it is an elective oligarchy whereby the electorate are offered an opportunity every few years to choose between competing parts of the elite—an elite in the UK whose general political ideas are largely held in common and go against the interests and wishes of most of the electorate.
817147979	63	None of this should be a surprise.
817147979	64	The sad truth: the central political question in all Western societies is—how far will the masses be able to control the naturally-abusive tendencies of the elite?
