833067493	3	Donald Trump Jr has used a Maury Povich meme to mock Democrats over the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
833067493	4	'Democrats, the test results are back, and Donald Trump is your daddy,' read the text on the image Trump Jr posted on Instagram Saturday, a day after Mueller filed his final report.
833067493	5	Trump Jr added in a comment: '... and your president,' along with three laughing emojis.

833067493	9	It came as President Donald Trump's supporters trumpeted reports that Mueller will seek no additional prosecutions, despite months of feverish predictions that Trump Jr or other close Trump associates would be the next to face indictment.
833067493	10	In the course of the 22-month investigation, Mueller has not charged any American with conspiring with the Russian government to break election laws, and Trump's supporters took word that there would be no further indictments as proof that the collusion allegations were false.
833067493	11	But the contents of the report have yet to be revealed, and Trump's opponents hope they will reveal malfeasance.

833067493	15	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement that Barr's offer to provide congressional committees with a summary of the report's conclusions is insufficient and that 'Congress requires the full report and the underlying documents.'
833067493	16	Senator Chris Coons, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Trump and his core team could still face legal risks even if the report does not find that they committed crimes.
833067493	17	Trump's business, his charity and his presidential transition operation remain under investigation, Coons said, and congressional Democrats would keep looking into his activities.
833067493	18	'It's the end of the beginning, but it's not the beginning of the end,' Coons told reporters on a telephone conference.
