822942601	1	Britain’s Gavin Williamson places Russia & China on notice, I'm not joking
822942601	3	UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is itching for conflict with Russia and China.
822942601	4	He’s not mad.
822942601	5	Not even slightly.
822942601	6	But he is stupid.
822942601	7	Very.
822942601	8	Unlike former fireplace salesman Gavin Williamson, I am no military expert.
822942601	9	But then you do not need to be one to understand that while Britain going to war with Russia and China might work as a video game, the real thing would be an exceedingly bad idea.
822942601	10	So why then in a speech delivered to the Royal United Services Institute in London, did Mr Williamson’s argument on the feasibility of the real thing elicit applause rather than the shrieks of horror and demands he be sacked forthwith it should have?
822942601	11	This is a serious question, by the way.
822942601	12	It is one that cuts through British establishment verbiage to reveal a country ruled not by the sober and doughty political heavyweights of years gone by, but by foaming fanatics in expensive suits.

822942601	14	Placing to one side for a moment the insanity of the very concept of Britain deploying hard power against Russia and/or China, the prospect of fighting a war against two designated enemies at the same time is a recipe for disaster.
822942601	15	Not satisfied with that, though, Mr Williamson is actually contemplating a conflict with three different enemies at the same time – i.e.
822942601	16	against Russia, China, and the millions of people in Britain his government is currently waging war against under the rubric of austerity.
822942601	17	“Today, Russia is resurgent," Mr Williamson said, “rebuilding its military arsenal and seeking to bring the independent countries of the former Soviet Union, like Georgia and Ukraine, back into its orbit.”
822942601	18	For Mr Williamson and his ilk a resurgent Russia is a bad thing.
822942601	19	Much better in their eyes if Russia, after the Soviet era in the 1990s, had remained on its knees as a free market desert; its state institutions in a state of near collapse and tens of millions of its citizens in the grip of immiseration.
822942601	20	Yes, because in that scenario Western ideologues like him would have had free rein to rampage around the world as they saw fit, setting fire to country after country on the perverse grounds of ‘saving them’ for democracy.

822942601	22	As it is, he and his still managed to squeeze in a considerable amount of carnage and chaos in the years it did take Russia to recover.
822942601	23	The indictment reads as follows: Yugoslavia destroyed; Afghanistan turned upside down; Iraq pushed into the abyss; Libya sent to hell.
822942601	24	By the time they turned their attention to Syria, intent on exploiting an Arab Spring that NATO in Libya transformed into an Arab Winter, Russia had recovered and was able to intervene.
822942601	25	It did so in concert with the Syrian Arab Army, Iran and Hezbollah to save the day – much to the evident chagrin of those who, like Gavin Williamson, prefer to see countries in ashes rather than independent of Western hegemony.
822942601	26	As to the facile nonsense about Russia trying to bring Georgia and Ukraine back into its orbit, both countries happen to share a border with Russia and both countries, in recent years, have been used by the UK and its allies as cat’s paws with the eastward expansion of NATO in mind.
822942601	27	It gets worse though: “The Alliance must develop its ability to handle the kind of provocations that Russia is throwing at us.
822942601	28	Such action from Russia must come at a cost.”
822942601	29	“Provocations,” the man said.
822942601	30	Since British troops have been taking part in exercises on Russia’s doorstep, not the other way round, one wonders if Gavin Williamson wrote this speech while inebriated.
822942601	31	It is Russia that has been on the receiving end of repeated provocations from NATO member states such as the UK in recent times, and it is Russia that has been forced to respond to protect its own security and that of its people where necessary.
822942601	32	Furthermore, not only in Russia but everywhere, including the UK, people understand that when you have political leaders intoxicated by their own national myths and propaganda to such an extent as Britain’s Defence Secretary, danger ensues.

822942601	34	The most enduring of those national myths where London is concerned is that the British Empire was a force for good rather than a vast criminal enterprise, that Britain and America won the Second World War together alone, that Iraq had WMDs, and that international law and international brigandage really are one and the same thing.
822942601	35	Perhaps the most preposterous section of the speech came when Mr Williamson tried to fashion a connection between Brexit and Britain’s military strength: “Brexit has brought us to a moment.
822942601	36	A great moment in our history.
822942601	37	A moment when we must strengthen our global presence, enhance our lethality, and increase our mass.”
822942601	38	Reading this, you can almost hear Churchill turning in his grave.
822942601	39	Britain’s wartime prime minister had such as Gavin Williamson in mind when he famously said, “He has all the virtues I dislike, and none of the vices I admire.”
822942601	40	Mr Williamson obviously misread the memo talking up not the opportunity for increased conflict with China after Brexit but trade.
822942601	41	This was not a speech it was a linguistic car crash, one that will forever command an honoured place in compendiums of the worst political speeches ever made.
822942601	42	As for Gavin Williamson, just as no responsible parent would ever dream of putting an 10-year old behind the wheel of car to drive unsupervised, no responsible British government would ever appoint a man like him as its Defence Secretary.
822942601	43	In years past, he would have struggled to find employment polishing the brass plate outside the building.
