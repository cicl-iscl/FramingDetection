815412286	1	Ex-MI6 chief says Theresa May’s Brexit deal ‘threatens national security,’ hurts US relationship
815412286	3	A former head of British intelligence agency MI6 has warned that Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal with the European Union threatens British national security by placing control of British security “in foreign hands.”
815412286	4	The letter, written by former MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove and former defence chief Lord Guthrie, and obtained first by Sky News, claims May’s controversial withdrawal agreement hurts NATO as well as “our close bilateral defence and intelligence relationship with the USA” and urges MPs to vote against the deal.

815412286	6	The first duty of the state, above trade, is the security of its citizens,” the letter says.
815412286	7	“The Withdrawal Agreement abrogates this fundamental contract and would place control of aspects of our national security in foreign hands.”
815412286	8	The deal, which is expected to be defeated in Parliament next week when it is voted on, has split May’s Conservative Party and sparked numerous resignations -- with Brexiteers unhappy that it would keep the U.K. in a customs union until a trade deal is forged.
815412286	9	The so-called “backstop” to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, has led to fears that it would keep Britain in the E.U.

815412286	11	Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said in his resignation letter that it would give the E.U.
815412286	12	“a veto over our ability to exit.”
815412286	13	Dearlove and Guthrie say that the deal “threatens to change our national security policy by binding us into new sets of E.U.-controlled relationships.” According to The Daily Telegraph, the letter also says that the deal is “the exact opposition of the people’s instruction to take back control” when Brits voted in 2016 to leave the bloc.
815412286	14	In response, 10 Downing Street told Sky that the claim by the former chiefs “is completely wrong.”

815412286	16	The letter is the latest blow to May’s push to get her agreement through Parliament ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure from the bloc at the end of March.
815412286	17	She has faced pressure from the pro-Brexit wing of her party to step down, but survived a vote of confidence from her own party last month.
815412286	18	Should she lose the vote on the deal next week, as expected, May will likely face fresh pressure to resign and possibly another vote of confidence -- this time in Parliament.
815412286	19	That could, in turn, lead to a general election.

815412286	23	May told reporters that it was her deal, or no deal at all:
815412286	24	"The only way to avoid no deal is to have a deal and to agree a deal, and the deal that is on the table, the deal that is the deal that the E.U.
815412286	25	has made clear is the only deal,” she said, before calling it a “good” deal.
