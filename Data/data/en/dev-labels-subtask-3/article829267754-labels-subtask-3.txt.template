829267754	1	Theresa May Doesn’t Have the Votes
829267754	3	Theresa May still does not appear to have the votes for her deal.
829267754	4	What then?
829267754	5	Extend and PretendEurointelligence says You Really Should Not Take EU’s Willingness to Extend for Granted.
829267754	6	One of the dangers of the Brexit debate is that everybody is making hidden assumptions about what others will do.
829267754	7	One of these assumptions is that the EU would only be too happy to extend the Brexit deadline.
829267754	8	The EU would, of course, extend to give time for ratification of a deal or even to make way for a cross-party deal.
829267754	9	But Theresa May would have to make clear pretty quickly that this is what she wants to do after the meaningful vote goes against her for a second time – which may well happen.
829267754	10	However, the idea that the EU is willing to accept a long extension, or a semi-permanent one, is fanciful for a number of reasons.
829267754	11	The most important relates to power politics within the EU.
829267754	12	The EPP has to be mindful of the impact a long delay would have on the balance of power, especially if it were to expel Viktor Orban.
829267754	13	If the UK were forced to hold European elections in May it would not send a single delegate to the EPP, which means that the EPP’s relative position in the parliament would weaken further.
829267754	14	A long delay would almost certain lead to an outcry among Brexit supporters, and could trigger a groundswell of support for Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party.
829267754	15	It appears to us that opposition to May’s deal among pro-Brexit MPs is hardening again – partly based on those delusions.

Tucker Carlson Best Price: $2.89 Buy New $7.30 (as of 09:15 EDT - Details) If the meaningful vote is negative – as it may well be – we assume that May would at this point try to reach a cross-party agreement to open up the discussion on the future relationship, by giving the House of Commons the right to pass instructions to the government for the post-Brexit negotiations.
829267754	17	At that point, a soft-Brexit majority would almost certainly assert itself.
829267754	18	In Brussels, meanwhile, the UK-EU talks are becoming more concrete.
829267754	19	Tony Connelly writes in RTE that the two sides were working on three separate strands: one on the guarantee of the backstop’s temporary nature; a second on the technological solutions that might replace the backstop; and a third on how to change the political declaration.
829267754	20	Negotiations are now in the hot phase – with an agreement due probably on Monday.
829267754	21	We doubt that the two sides would want to give the British press much time to take this deal apart.
829267754	22	Soft Brexit?
829267754	23	Eurointelligence assumes a soft-Brexit majority would almost certainly assert itself.
829267754	24	But I am not certain what they means by a soft Brexit.
829267754	25	Regardless, unless there is some sort of binding guarantee by the EU as a backstop replacement, one can hardly be certain of anything.
829267754	26	Deal or No Deal?​
829267754	27	Christopher Howarth, a senior research analyst for the House of Commons, says Deal or No deal, Brexit Cannot be Stopped.
829267754	28	Howarth concludes “If the Government brings back the same deal without an exit to the backstop, it will be defeated.
829267754	29	If it is defeated, there will be no second referendum or prolonged stay in the EU.
829267754	30	The UK will leave.
829267754	31	In short, don’t panic: if MPs hold their nerve, we are leaving the EU on 29th March without a permanent backstop.”
829267754	32	In short, Howarth either believes the EU will budge or there will be a no-deal Brexit.
829267754	33	I am not as confident as Howarth but I believe his take is more likely than that of Eurointelligence.
829267754	34	Crunching the Numbers – Guardian
829267754	35	The Guardian did the math as it stands today [March 5 as reported by Eurointelligence] : May needs an additional 110 votes to get the deal through – from a pool of 115 Tory MPs and 40 Labour MPs in leave-voting seats.
829267754	36	There are 7 pro-Remain Tory MPs who said they will vote against the deal without a referendum.
829267754	37	This leaves a total of 148 MPs.
829267754	38	If 10-20 Tory Brexiteers reject the deal, she will need to pick up some 20-30 or so Labour MPs to get it through.
829267754	39	And it seems that the best way to get those Labour MPs lined up would be an open vote on the future relationship, including the option a customs union.
829267754	40	There is no chance of the UK parliament aligning behind any option for so long as Brexit itself has not happened.
829267754	41	But, once it has, the probability of agreement is large simply because the more extreme Brexit options – leave without a deal or re-run the referendum – will have been eliminated.
829267754	42	This is why a two-stage ratification is much more likely to succeed than a once-and-for-all vote.
829267754	43	Convoluted Position
829267754	44	The Eurointelligence position seems more than a bit convoluted.

829267754	46	Supposedly, once Brexit happens, leave without a deal will be off the table.
829267754	47	Not Enough Votes
829267754	48	Bloomberg’s Brexit Bulletin concludes Not Enough Votes
829267754	49	Prime Minister Theresa May’s chief whip told the Cabinet on Tuesday he’s not confident he has the numbers to get her exit accord approved next week, and predicted that a defeat would be followed by Parliament forcing the U.K. to maintain closer ties with the European Union.
829267754	50	Julian Smith, the man with the impossible job of manufacturing majorities for May’s Brexit policy, told ministers that the vote will be tight and he doesn’t know which way it’s going to go, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
829267754	51	Meanwhile, the signals from the Labour camp don’t look good for May.
829267754	52	Labour officials are sounding increasingly upbeat that they will be able to contain the potential voting rebellion in their ranks.
829267754	53	Speaking privately, three officials said they’re confident fewer than 10 Labour lawmakers would vote with May, even though whips have as many as 30 members of Parliament on their list of potential rebels.
829267754	54	The less likely the deal is to pass, the less inclined wavering lawmakers might be to risk their careers to back it.
829267754	55	May’s latest efforts to get Labour MPs on board are falling flat.
829267754	56	Cash handouts for pro-Brexit regions were widely criticized earlier this week and the government’s long-awaited announcement on protecting workers’ rights after Brexit — also aimed at giving Labour MPs an excuse to back the agreement — have been slammed as insufficient.
829267754	57	Meaningful Vote
829267754	58	The first two Bloomberg paragraphs above sound like hogwash and fearmongering by Theresa May.
829267754	59	The second two paragraphs are more realistic.
829267754	60	Unless the EU agrees to modify the backstop in a meaningful way the vote will go down.
829267754	61	If it’s close, then expect May to keep submitting it to vote.
829267754	62	That’s way I don’t have overriding confidence in the opinion of Howarth.
829267754	63	If a vote fails a second time May will put forth an amendment to take no-deal off the Table.
829267754	64	The problem for May and the UK parliament is such a vote is not legally binding.
829267754	65	The UK leaves on March 29 unless the UK parliament passes something the EU agree with.
829267754	66	That’s why I have no confidence in the opinion of Eurointelligence.
829267754	67	Curiously, Eurointelligence says don’t take for granted the EU will extend, yet it fully expects an extension.
829267754	68	I expect one too, but lasting no longer than June.
829267754	69	Otherwise, the UK will be represented in the EU parliament and will make a mess of things.
829267754	70	Malthouse Compromise
829267754	71	I keep returning to the Malthouse Compromise.
829267754	72	It is the one solution that seems to be a reasonable alternative for everyone but the hard remainers.
829267754	73	Under the Malthouse Compromise, Brexit happens and the backstop stays in place for a maximum of two years.
829267754	74	Then and only then is there a hard Brexit, assuming the UK and EU cannot come up with a backstop replacement.
829267754	75	The EU labels this a unicorn.
829267754	76	If the Brexiteers repeatedly hold their ground, I expect something like the Malthouse compromise to win.
829267754	77	Theresa May may resign first, or not.
829267754	78	But if so, Tories are back in the lead in polls, and there is the possibility they can pick a suitable candidate that could get a majority right now.
