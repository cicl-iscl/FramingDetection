833028932	3	The Mueller Report Finally Drops, Dems Prepare List of Demands
833028932	4	It's Friday, that means it is panel time!
833028932	5	Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has submitted a confidential report to US Attorney General William P. Barr, marking the end of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump, a Justice Department spokeswoman said.
833028932	6	The Justice Department notified Congress late Friday that it had received Mueller's report but did not describe its contents.
833028932	7	Barr is expected to summarize the findings for lawmakers in the coming days.
833028932	8	UK Prime Minister Theresa May previously sought agreement by the EU's 27 leaders on a "technical extension" of Article 50, pushing Brexit day back to June 30, in the event that the House of Commons ratifies the withdrawal agreement in its third vote on the deal.
833028932	9	The extra time would be needed to pass the necessary legislation.
833028932	10	May's appeal to the heads of state and government was described by sources as "90 minutes of nothing."
833028932	11	She was unable to offer any answers as to how a no-deal Brexit would be avoided if the deal were rejected again.
833028932	12	The leaders imposed a new Brexit timeline on the prime minister to avoid a possible accidental no-deal scenario next Friday, March 29.
833028932	13	Under the new timeline, Britain will stay a member state until April 12 if the withdrawal agreement is rejected by MPs.
833028932	14	If lawmakers accept the prime minister's Brexit deal, the UK will leave the EU by May 22.
833028932	15	The government will be able to seek a longer extension if it can "indicate a way forward" and agrees to hold European elections.
833028932	16	The FBI has reportedly joined a criminal investigation of the certification process for Boeing's 737 Max 8 jets, two of which have crashed since October, killing 346 people.
833028932	17	The Seattle Times first reported that the bureau is assisting federal aviation investigators in a federal grand jury probe based in Washington, DC, looking into the process.
833028932	18	Indonesian airline Garuda said Friday that it's canceling a multi-billion-dollar order for 49 737 Max 8 jets in light of the deadly crashes.
833028932	19	"Our passengers have lost confidence to fly with the Max 8," Garuda spokesperson Ikhsan Rosan told CNN.
833028932	20	The Indonesian carrier ordered 50 of the planes in 2014 for $4.9 billion.
833028932	21	It has taken delivery of one of them but has now sent a letter to Boeing saying it no longer wants to receive the remaining jets on order, Ikhsan said.
833028932	22	Garuda is the first airline to say it's canceling a 737 Max 8 order.
833028932	23	US President Donald Trump on Thursday took more shots at the late Sen. John McCain, despite growing calls from Republicans and veterans groups to stop attacking the Arizona GOP lawmaker who died last year.
833028932	24	In an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump called McCain "horrible" for his 2017 vote against a congressional Republican measure to repeal Obamacare and accused him of handing a dossier of explosive claims about Trump's ties to Russia to the FBI for "very evil purposes."
833028932	25	When asked by anchor Maria Bartiromo why he continues to criticize McCain, who died seven months ago after battling brain cancer, Trump claimed he was prompted by the news media.
833028932	26	"I don't talk about it," the president said.
833028932	27	"People ask me the question.
833028932	28	I didn't bring this up.
833028932	29	You just brought it up.
833028932	30	You just asked the question."
833028932	31	Trump renewed his attacks on McCain last weekend in an apparent reaction to a news report about the controversial dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele, not after he was asked about his attitude toward the senator.
833028932	32	He has continued to lash out at McCain over the past several days, telling reporters on Tuesday, "I was never a fan of John McCain, and I never will be," and then on Wednesday grousing about not receiving a "thank you" for approving funeral arrangement plans for McCain, despite his dislike for the former senator.
833028932	33	McCain was memorialized at Washington's National Cathedral last fall, and Trump was not invited to attend.
833028932	34	Trump authorized a government airplane to transport McCain's remains from Arizona to the nation's capital, but the cathedral said Trump's approval was not needed to host the funeral.
833028932	35	It took New Zealand just six days to announce an immediate plan to change to the nation's gun policy after a gunman killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch last week.
833028932	36	On Thursday, a day after the first victims were laid to rest, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a national ban on all military-style semiautomatic weapons, all high-capacity ammunition magazines and all parts that allow weapons to be modified into the kinds of guns used in last week's attack.
833028932	37	Ms. Ardern is expected to encounter little resistance in Parliament.
833028932	38	The new law could be in place as soon as April 11.
