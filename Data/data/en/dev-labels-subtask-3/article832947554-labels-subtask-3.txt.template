832947554	1	Tom Steyer Rallies Supporters after Conclusion of Mueller Report
832947554	3	Left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer issued a video on Friday rallying supporters after the lackluster conclusion of the report issued by special counsel Robert Mueller.
832947554	4	Mueller’s report did not include any additional criminal indictments, despite leftists dreaming that President Donald Trump or members of his family would be sent to jail as a result of the investigation.
832947554	5	Steyer called for “perspective,” reminding them that Mueller already indicted people connected to Trump such as Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Rick Gates, and George Papadopoulos.
832947554	6	“It has already led to the indictment of 34 individuals,” Steyer said, leaving out the fact that 26 of them were Russians as well as three Russian companies.
832947554	7	He reminded supporters that the Mueller report had sparked other investigations into “Mr.
832947554	8	Trump’s criminality.”
832947554	9	Steyer called for Attorney General William Barr to do a full release of the report.
832947554	10	He urged supporters to cling to the idea that Trump already “participated in crimes” while in the presidency.
832947554	11	“Let’s learn as much as we can from this report knowing that the information is already in that this president needs to be impeached,” Steyer said.
832947554	12	We already know from other continuing investigations that the sitting president has committed crimes in office.
832947554	13	Let's learn as much as we can from Mueller, while remembering @realdonaldtrump long ago passed the threshold for impeachment.
